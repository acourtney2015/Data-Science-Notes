VISUALIZATION (a.k.a. Web publishing)

The best way to dive into visualization is by perusing the canonical examples in the d3.js gallery. Spend some time playing with the demos and ask yourself "How can this become more useful?" Indeed, most of the gallery is frivolous, but the potential is undeniable.

D3 tutorials have come a long way in a short time thanks to people like Scott Murray. He did a great O'Reilly webcast http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2952
There's also youtube videos with Mike Dewar and Malcom Maclean has published D3 Tips and Tricks with Leanpub. http://www.d3noob.org/

Other noteworthy visualization platforms are DataWrapper, Flot, Highcharts, TheJit, Arbor.js, and Kartograph. These libraries depend on JavaScript, SVG and CSS, which is why I consider data visualization synonymous with web publishing.
